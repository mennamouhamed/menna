                Aswan is a city in Southern Egypt, and is the capital of the Aswan Governorate.
                Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the Aswan Dam on the east bank of the Nile at the first cataract.
                 The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of Elephantine.
                Aswan includes five monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae; 
                these are the Old and Middle Kingdom tombs of Qubbet el-Hawa, the town of Elephantine, the stone quarries and Unfinished Obelisk,
                 the Monastery of St. Simeon and the Fatimid Cemetery.[6] The city's Nubian Museum is an important archaeological center, 
                 containing finds from the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia before the Aswan Dam flooded all of Lower Nubia.
