                Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, 
                the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world,
                 including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures,
                 among which are the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples.
                 Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, 
                 the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.
